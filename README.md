In this paper, we explored the evolution *G2/Jockey-3*, a transposable element (TE) enriched within the centromeres of *Drosophila melanogaster*. We hypothesized *G2/Jockey-3* natural selection may maintain centromere copies giving evidence for the a role in centromere function or it is targeting the centromere to avoid removal by purifying selection. We found evidence that *G2/Jockey-3* is an active element which preferentially targets the centromeres. However, most centromere copies are older with little evidence for conservation by natural selection. This suggests that *G2/Jockey-3* behaves like a selfish element and the TE is not entirely domesticated by the genome.
